# Curiosity.Common.Mvc

A friendly library for working with [ASP.NET MVC3](http://www.asp.net/mvc). Nothing spectacular. Just a lot of helpful stuff that we tend to use in every project.

This library is available as a NuGet package. Check out its [NuGet gallery page](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Curiosity.Common.Mvc). Or read [the wiki](https://github.com/jarrettmeyer/curiosity-common-mvc/wiki) for more info.
